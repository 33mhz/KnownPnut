Pnut.io Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides pnut.io syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles and status updates.

It provides basic status update and post syndication; currently more advanced features (file uploads, starring etc) are not supported. Syndication links (back links & outward links) are not currently working, but the pnutAPI is under active development.

Pull requests welcome!
